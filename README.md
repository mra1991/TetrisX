# TetrisX
A simple version of Tetris as a C# Windows application

This project is a C# windows application that emulates a classic tetris-like game. 
The game features 7 different tetriminos made up of four squares, each with a randomly assigned color. 
The game speeds up as the player advances to higher levels. 
The player can preview the next tetrimino to strategize their gameplay. 
This project showcases various features, 
such as random object creation, collision detection and increasing difficulty levels.
